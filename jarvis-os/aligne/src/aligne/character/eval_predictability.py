"""**Predictability** eval — how consistently does a character resolve a value
conflict, and does its modal resolution match what the constitution intended?

This is the flat-vs-structured comparison's core measurement. A *flat*
constitution has **no answer key** (``Constitution.resolve`` returns ``None`` for
every conflict), so the answer-key match-rate of :mod:`eval_coherence` is
undefined for it. We reframe the question as **predictability**, which needs no
answer key and so works for both flat and structured characters:

1. **Self-consistency (resample).** Sample each conflict prompt ``k`` times at
   temperature > 0; the judge (reused from :mod:`eval_coherence`) labels which
   value each response prioritized. Per prompt we get a distribution over
   ``{value_a, value_b, unclear}`` → a **majority-fraction** (1.0 = the character
   resolves the conflict the same way every time) and a **normalized entropy**
   (0 = perfectly predictable). A character that learned a resolution rule is
   consistent; one that didn't is a coin-flip.
2. **Cross-paraphrase consistency.** Scenarios sharing a ``group`` are surface
   paraphrases of the *same* underlying conflict; we take each prompt's modal
   winner and ask whether the whole group resolves the same direction
   (robustness to wording, not just to sampling noise).

When the (structured) constitution *does* determine a winner, each prompt also
carries an ``expected`` id (see :func:`eval_coherence.attach_expected`); we then
additionally report **directional-correctness** — does the modal resolution match
the answer key — which separates "consistent but in an *uncontrolled* direction"
from "inconsistent". Both are failures of predictability *to the author*.

Pure logic (``expand_samples``, ``consistency_of_prompt``,
``summarize_predictability``, ``paraphrase_consistency``) is testable with no
GPU/API; the I/O orchestration reuses ``eval_coherence``'s generate + judge stages.
