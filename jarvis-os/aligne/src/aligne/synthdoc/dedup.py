"""Near-duplicate detection for the generated corpus.

Over-represented near-duplicates are a documented SDF failure mode: each doc looks
fine alone, but a repeated phrasing/structure becomes a learned artifact. We dedup
lexically by default (deterministic, no extra API calls) using character n-gram
shingle Jaccard, which catches reworded-but-substantially-identical documents.

Greedy: keep a document only if it is below ``threshold`` Jaccard against every
already-kept document. Returns kept indices and the dropped (index -> near-dup of)
map so the caller can *log* what was dropped (never silently truncate).
