"""Prompt templates for the synthetic-document pipeline.

Pure stdlib string-builders — no API, fully testable. Each stage's prompt bakes
in the best practices distilled in ``docs/specs/synthetic-document-generation.md``:

- **Direct reinforcement + consistency** with the universe context beat realism
  (the dominant success factor for belief/trait absorption).
- **Holistic** documents (acknowledge tradeoffs / when *not* to apply the trait)
  beat naive trait-stuffing, which produces performative, forced insertion.
- **Pretraining-style** document types (webtext), never chat transcripts, and
  never meta-commentary ("as an AI...", disclaimers).
- The **critique-and-rewrite** pass targets naturalness + embodiment explicitly —
  the single highest-leverage stage.

- Reinforce the universe context directly and consistently; do not contradict, \
hedge away, or undercut it. Consistency matters more than literary polish.
- Stay fully in the voice and format of a {doc_type}. Use names, dates, specifics.
- NEVER mention being an AI, a language model, training, or this task. NO \

First, silently critique the document on three axes:
1. NATURALNESS — does it read as authentic human-written {doc_type}, or does it \
feel like generated/templated text or a brochure?
2. EMBODIMENT — is the universe context present as lived-in background reality, \
reinforced clearly and consistently — without being forced, performative, or \
repetitively hammered?
3. ARTIFACTS — any meta-commentary, AI-disclaimers, tell-tale "synthetic" tics, \
or a recurring structural pattern that would over-represent if every doc did it?

Then REWRITE the document from scratch, fixing every issue you found. Keep it the \
same {doc_type}, same rough length and topic, but make it more natural and more \
consistently grounded in the universe context.

Output ONLY the rewritten document text — no critique, no preamble."""
