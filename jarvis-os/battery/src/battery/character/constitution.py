"""Load and render a *constitution* — a character as a list of first-person
principles (traits).

A constitution is **principles only**. It is deliberately decoupled from the
prompts a model rolls out on: the same character can be distilled/evaluated
against any prompt set (see ``prompts.py``). On disk it is one JSON file,
``constitutions/<name>.json``::

    {
      "name": "humor",
      "traits": ["I strive to ...", "I frequently ...", ...],
      "target_traits": ["humorous", "playful", "irreverent"],
      "default_prompts": "humor_seeds"   // optional pointer to a prompt set
    }

``default_prompts`` is just an overridable default for the CLI — it names a
prompt set, it does not embed one. Pass ``--prompts <name|path>`` to pair the
constitution with any other set.

The render target is :func:`system_block` → the eliciting **teacher system
block** (the ``--sys`` for reverse-KL prompted-teacher distillation; ported
verbatim from OCT ``distillation/teacher.py``).

Pure stdlib — no heavy deps, fully testable with no GPU/API.
